                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> I am a third year student at Carnegie Mellon University. The majority of my working experience has been in research. I have been a research assistant on multiple projects, and have even lead my own projects under the supervision of my professors. I plan on graduating with a Bachelors of Science degree in Psychology, and a Bachelors degree in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). My major goal in life is to change the way people and the world interact with technology and information. My second personal goal is to become a videogame developer. In addition to my academics and research I enjoy participating in Scotch'n'Soda Theatre and working as an Orientation Leader.</p>
